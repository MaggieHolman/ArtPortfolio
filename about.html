              <h3>I am a rising junior at the University of Michigan Engineering school studying Computer Science and minoring in UX Design! 
              I have always loved designing along with science and math, so computer science is the perfect field for me to brigde my two passions!</h3>

            <div class="about-text-description">
              <h3>Ever since I was little I have loved all mediums of art, my passion for creating is what makes me who I am! My grandma was an amazing artist 
              and taught me the basics of color theory, perspective, and much more. Since her passing, art has been a great way for me to stay connected with her
              and continue both of our passions. I have participated in several art fairs and love talking with customers, it's a great feeling knowing there are people
              out there who enjoy the art I create! Oil painting has always been my favorites since that is the medium that my grandma taught me, however, I 
              have dabbled in mediums such as clay, colored pencils, water color, digital design, and acrylic! Art will always be an important part of who I am
              and hope to incorporate it into many facets of my life!</h3>

            <div class="outside-text-description">
              <h3>When I'm not creating I'm usually playing the paino, hanging with friends and family, or playing pickleball! I have been playing piano for over 15 years
              and have found it as a great way to express myself outside of painting! I am also Vice President of the professional fraternity Tau Epsilon Kappa
              at U of M, and have thoroughly enjoyed being apart of such a great community of like-minded people sharing a passion for technology! A great way 
              to get my mind off of the stresses of school and work is by playing pickleball with friends, it's a fun social sport that has allowed me to make 
              great friends and get out of the classroom!</h3>
